### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Experienced Architect and Construction Engineer with 9+ years of industry experience with a Bachelor of Engineering in Architecture and Construction, I possess the technical & soft skills necessary for my work. I have successfully overseen numerous construction projects from conception to completion. In my role at DAHAB DESIGN our family company and other Freelance Projects, I am responsible for planning and designing project schematics, project managing, process & cost documentation, and interacting with customers to ensure timely delivery of high-quality projects within budget limits.I also have expertise in design softwares such as AutoCAD, Revit, 3DMax, Photoshop, Lumion and implementing 3D designs in Virtual-Reality.

As our company grew and specialized at diffrent branches (Real-Estate, Architecture & Furniture), I decided to create a portfolio website for our company, so I obtained an online professional certificate in FrontEnd Engineering. Using my technical skills, which include proficiency in programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and technologies like React, Redux, Express.js, Node.JS, Git, and Git actions, I designed and developed from scratch a mobile-responsive single-page-application portfolio website for our company with a server-side component to store API calls.

While learning Frontend development and building our company's portfolio website, I discovered a new passion for web development. I enjoyed the process of designing and coding the website and I am thrilled to make other real-life web applications that are useful and visually appealing. With my technical skills and experience in project management, I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality web applications that meet the needs and requirements of clients. I look forward to taking on new challenges and expanding my knowledge in the field of web development.
